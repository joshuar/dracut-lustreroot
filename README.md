# About

This is a dracut module to provide support for booting a machine with
its root on LustreFS.  This module is based largely on concepts in the
modules included with dracut, namely the nfs, netroot and syslog
modules.

# Requirements

 - A working Lustre cluster/filesystem.
 - Linux install on Lustre FS.
 - PXE boot support on network.
 - Dracut v003 or higher

# Usage

## Installation

 - Install this module under the dracut `modules.d` directory (usually
   located at either `/usr/share/dracut/modules.d` or
   `/usr/lib/dracut/modules.d` depending on your distribution.
 - You can safely remove files with names referencing an OS you don't use
 - Remove release name from file names (e.g. `mv install-centos6.5 install`)

## Configuration

 - Edit the dracut configuration file and change the
   `dracut_addmodules` parameter to include *lustre*.
 - Edit your kernel command-line and include the following three
   arguments as outlined below:
  - `lustreserver`: IP address and interface on which to connect to
   lustre server in *lnet* format. e.g., `IPaddr@o2ib` or
   `IPaddr@tcp0`.
  - `lustrefs`: Lustre filesystem to mount. e.g., `/lustrefs1`.
  - *(Optional)* `lustrepath`: Directory path on Lustre filesystem to use as root.
   e.g., `/images/centos/6.5`.
  - *(Optional)* `lustreopts`: Mount options for Lustre.  See **mount.lustre(8)**.
 - Rebuild your initramfs with dracut.

# Limitations

 - Only tested with CentOS, releases 6.5 and 7.3.
